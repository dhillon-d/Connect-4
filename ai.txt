Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something
more clever than just pick a random legal move?

No I did not attempt to make my computer very smart.

If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as
you would like?

This question is non applicable to me.

How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your
“pick next move” algorithm

My algorithm is very complicated, basically it just picks a random open spot
and drops the disk.

How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever
tested it out for you?

My computer is able to beat someone if they are really bad because all the
algorithm does is drop randomly.

How would you improve it in the future?

I would improve it in the future by detecting how many colors in a row there
are for the computers color. Then I would have the computer drop the disk to
try and increase the amount of yellow disks in a row.
